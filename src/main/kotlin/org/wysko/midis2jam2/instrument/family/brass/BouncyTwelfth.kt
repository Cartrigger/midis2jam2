/**
 * A single instance of some visual that "bounces" to visualize (e.g., choir peep, stage horn). Specifically, when the
 * note begins playing, the model rises up into the air, then slowly falls back down for the duration of the note.
 *
 * BouncyTwelfths animate by keeping track of how much time has elapsed since [play] is called, which is
 * passed the number of seconds the twelfth should fall for. This does mean that the rate at which the twelfth falls is
 * not proportional to the current tempo of the MIDI file.
 *
 * If a [play] is called before it is finished falling, the animation resets.
